ðŸŸ¡ Option 1: Open Settings JSON the correct way
Press Ctrl + Shift + P

Type: "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"

Select it (donâ€™t open Default Settings (JSON) â€” that one is read-only)

ðŸ”´ If it says read-only at the top like below:

cpp
Copy
Edit
// This file is automatically generated and should not be edited.
Then you're in the wrong one â€” that's the default.

âœ… You want the user settings, which is editable and should NOT say "read-only". 

add this:-

{
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "html": "html",
    "javascript": "javascript"
  },
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "strings": true
  }
}
